# content_scanner


## What does it do?

This program can be used to check whether any keywords from a list you supply feature in the source code of any of the URLs that you feed it.

### Requirements

Python 3 should be installed on your machine.


# Usage - MAC/LINUX

To use this script, first cd into the directory you would like to work from.
Next grab a copy of this project by typing into your terminal "git clone https://github.com/Th3Blacksmith/content_scanner.git".
You might now want to change the list of words in the keywords.txt document to suit your purpose. Put each new word on its own line.
You might also want to change the list of URL's in the files.csv file. Again, keep each url on its own line.

To run this script, simply type "sudo ./content_scanner.py". You will be presented with a message telling you that the process has started, followed by the results and then a process complete message.
